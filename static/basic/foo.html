<!--@htmlc|

	htmlc will ignore whitespace or any comment data that remains outside of the ~ character open/closure
	users may have 1 or many ~{}~ scopes inside an @htmlc block, and if you want the
	comments around the marked sections to remain in tact you can enable it in the configuration options

	~<section class="page-section">
    <h4>@render=(section_title)</h4>
	@loop=(section_items){
		|<div>{item.name}</div>|;
		|<b>{item.price}</b>|
	}
	</section>~
